# tinyxml2_wchar_t
wchar_t (not char) version of tinyxml2

The original works with UTF8 or ANSI encoding.
And here is the UTF16-LE version of tinyxml2.

I only make it work on Windows and haven't test on other platforms.
Please let me know if you have encounterred any problem on other platforms.

Best Regards,
Yilin
